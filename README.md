# BRUCE Cybersecurity Database Search Engine

The BRUCE Engine is a database search function that allows a user to search for a large number of cybersecurity courses through the domain bruce.ist.psu.edu. A search can return many courses in the area of cybersecurity. Each search result contains information such as professor, university, and textbook. It also includes a link to the course syllabus website and a screenshot preview of what the website looks like.
